Everything is close together , with limited space between walls and objects. Colorwise, Hell is on the darker side, with a blackish and slightly greenish color palette. Everything looks shadowy and gloomy as there doesn't appear to be a consistent light source.",

It appears to be endless without any objects in sight, with occasional exceptions. Another significant detail is that Heaven entirely consists of the color white. The floor, wall, ceiling, pillars, and even windows only appear as white, making Heaven visually a very bright place.",
