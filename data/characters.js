    personality: "Aziraphale is generally very bubbly and cheerful and keen to do the right thing. He can become a bit anxious if he has to do something that isn’t 100% good such as lying. He also has difficulty recognizing gray morality compared to Crowley. He automatically assumes that Heaven are the good guys and Hell are the bad guys, often using this to try to justify some of Heaven’s more unpleasant actions.",
