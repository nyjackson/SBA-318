    personality: "Aziraphale is generally very bubbly and cheerful and keen to do the right thing. He can become a bit anxious if he has to do something that isn’t 100% good such as lying. He also has difficulty recognizing gray morality compared to Crowley. He automatically assumes that Heaven are the good guys and Hell are the bad guys, often using this to try to justify some of Heaven’s more unpleasant actions.",

    species: "Demon",
    personality: "Crowley is overall a non-threatening demon. He somewhat attempts to be evil in his own way, but is actually quite morally decent in human terms. He objects to the killing of innocent people and animals and wants to save the world, albeit for his own reasons. He has a flair for the dramatic and can be a heavy drinker. He seems to not take his job seriously and doesn't really partake in 'normal demon' things. Most of his 'accomplishments' were faked or done by humans, whom he considers are better at making their own lives miserable than he is. He thinks of himself as evil, but is usually a minor inconvenience at worst.",
    quotes: ["Oh, Lord, heal this bike.", "Excuse me ma'am, we're two supernatural entities looking for the notorious son of Satan, wonder if you might help us with our inQUIRIES?","Sorry, consecrated ground. Ah, it's like being on the beach in bare feet!","Because humans are weird and that's how it works.","What kind of stupid question is that ‘still a demon’? What else am I going to be? An aardvark?"],

    personality: "He is a friendly young boy. He is somewhat confident and a bit bossy as the leader of the Them, but is also shown to be very caring to his friends and other people he meets such as Anathema. He is shown to be a bit naive, as he believes everything he reads in the magazines that Anathema gives him and initially believes that Armageddon is the only way to undo all the damage that has been done to the Earth and make things right.",
